# Multi-Layer-Perceptron

## The Keras Interface

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.

## Keras & Tensorflow 2.x

- TensorFlow 2.0 is an end-to-end, open-source machine learning platform. You can think of it as an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming.

- Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2.0: an approchable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. 
- It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developing and shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.

- Keras empowers engineers and researchers to take full advantage of the scalability and cross-platform capabilities of TensorFlow 2.0: you can run Keras on TPU or on large clusters of GPUs, and you can export your Keras models to run in the browser or on a mobile device.

## Install Tensorflow 2.x (keras gets installed automatically)

####Requires the latest pip (TensorFlow 2 packages require a pip version >19.0)<br>
__pip install --upgrade pip__

#####Current stable release for CPU and GPU<br>
__pip install tensorflow__
